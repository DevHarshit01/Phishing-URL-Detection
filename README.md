# Phishing URL Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. Phishing URLs are malicious links designed to steal sensitive information from users. This tool aims to identify such URLs and help protect users from potential threats.

## Features
- Detect phishing URLs with high accuracy.
- Utilizes machine learning models for classification.
- Easy-to-use interface for URL analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/phishing-url-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd phishing-url-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the URL you want to analyze.
3. View the results to determine if the URL is safe or a phishing attempt.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of URLs labeled as phishing or legitimate. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format before training the model.

## Model Training
To train the model:
1. Prepare the dataset.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.
